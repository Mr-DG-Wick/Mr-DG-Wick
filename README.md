### About Me

I'm a student with a passion for computer science who is driven by curiosity to solve complex problems that have an immediate impact using code and algorithms. Naturally curious, I thoroughly enjoy asking questions about how things work and how they can be improved. However, my realization of truly enjoying problem-solving with immediate impact has only come through experiential learning. 

I am an individual who derives profound fulfillment from the work I engage in, firmly convinced that true satisfaction is achieved through crafting solutions to captivating problems. I am constantly seeking opportunities to optimize both new and existing solutions, driven by my unwavering desire to tackle challenging problems head-on.
