### Ambitious projects
- [Lamp Attack](https://youtu.be/w5oKCQUjC4A) : An International short animation movie project. As the name suggests, the movie is a dark comedy revolving around our own familiar pixar lamps. Being a part of the project, I worked on developing models and texturing them to fit for the theme of the project. Project was highly organized and we premiered it on Oct 2, 2021.
